Brian Kernighanâ€™s algorithm is used to find the number of set bits in a number. 
The idea behind the algorithm is that when we subtract one from an integer, all the bits following the rightmost set of bits are inverted, turning 1 to 0 and 0 to 1. 
The rightmost set bit also gets inverted with the bits right to it.
