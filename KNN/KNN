In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric supervised learning method. 
Most often, it is used for classification, as a k-NN classifier, the output of which is a class membership. 

An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). 
If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
