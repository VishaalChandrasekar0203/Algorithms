Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a data clustering algorithm. 
It is a density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed (points with many nearby neighbors), and marks as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (those whose nearest neighbors are too far away).
