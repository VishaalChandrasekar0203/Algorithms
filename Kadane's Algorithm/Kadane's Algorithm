Kadane's algorithm scans the given array from left to right. In the jth step, it computes the subarray with the largest sum ending at j; this sum is maintained in variable current_sum. 
Moreover, it computes the subarray with the largest sum anywhere in A[1â€¦j], maintained in variable best_sum, and easily obtained as the maximum of all values of current_sum seen so far.
